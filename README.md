## nspirectl - Manage files on TI-nspire devices

A simple wrapper for the libnspire functions as a command line tool. I made this mostly because I just cant get tilp to work. If there's any mistakes or you have any suggestions, even tiny little picky ones, dont hesitate to contact me or submit a pull request.

## Building
First, install [libnspire](https://github.com/Vogtinator/libnspire).

Then run
```
make
```
and put the `./nspirectl` binary anywhere you want, like `/usr/local/bin`.
